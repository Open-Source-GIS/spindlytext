Spindlytext
===========

This library lets you write in the sky in Google Earth (and the Google Earth plugin) using KML LineStrings. It was developed as part of [Pigeon Sim](https://github.com/jawj/pigeonsim).

Demo
----

Here's [a simple example usage](http://jawj.github.com/spindlytext/).

Documentation
-------------

None yet, but between [the demo source](https://github.com/jawj/spindlytext/blob/gh-pages/index.html) and [the library source](https://github.com/jawj/spindlytext/blob/master/spindlytext.coffee) you can probably figure it out.

Character set
-------------

A key part of the library is its homegrown, spindly font. I think I've included all the characters you're likely to see in everyday English, but very few accented characters are implemented. Pull requests welcome here.

TODO
----

A method returning a three.js THREE.Line might be handy.
